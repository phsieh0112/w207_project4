# Project 4: Poisonous Mushrooms

Author: Tina Hsieh

Course: W207 Session 9

In this project, I investigated properties of mushrooms. This classic dataset contains over 8000 examples, where each describes a mushroom by a variety of features like color, odor, etc., and the target variable is an indicator for whether the mushroom is poisonous. The feature space has been binarized.
